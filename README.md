# Expense-tracker
An expense tracker app built when working through a React course on Udemy, but expanded with my own additions and features.

### Concepts Covered:
By building this app, I learned the following:
- Components
- Props
- State
- Two-way binding
- Handling forms in React
- Passing data to parent components, “lifting state up”
- Rendering lists
- Rendering conditional content

### Additions beyond what's in the course
In addition to what's in the course, I expanded on the project by adding my own features, including the following:
- Fully updated design (shout out to my UX Designer colleague for the new design)
- New feature that allows users to add additional expense data in the form of a ‘type’ and then filter by that type
- Each expense item shows an icon that corresponds to it’s type
- Additional ‘All’ option added to each filter so that users can see all expense data at once
